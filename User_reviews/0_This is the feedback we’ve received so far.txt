i have a friend who wants to save alot of screenshots but from a certain game.
maybe add a feature that will use app id (optional)

It's easy to implement. I just need to modify this link. I can add a button. I'll update it tomorrow.

I was searching for hours and hours to find a good screenshot downloader and i randomly found this video in youtube
this one is by far the best one, keep up the good work, i managed to download 12k screenshots
The guide was clear and easy to understand Thank you!
