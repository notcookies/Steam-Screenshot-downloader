## How to use it?

###  Walkthrough video v2.9:

#### for windows:
#### https://youtu.be/0WJbpMG1QcA
#### https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1h5WkzjE9q/

#### for Linux:
#### https://youtu.be/BHZo82LMW28

#### for SteamOS:
#### https://youtu.be/MILDMs-jR7w

## Two special cases:
- **```Missing required cookies from Chromium session```.
  Refer to this typical case: [Issue #11](https://github.com/notcookies/Steam-Screenshot-downloader/issues/11)
"I used the Steam app on iOS to log out of all devices. After that, I changed my password. Then I followed the tutorial steps again, and only after that did everything work as expected - the screenshots downloaded."**

- **```UU```+```SteamScreenshotDownloader```: [Issue #4](https://github.com/notcookies/Steam-Screenshot-downloader/issues/4)**

## Disclaimer:

**This tool uses**

**```from DrissionPage import ChromiumPage, ChromiumOptions```**

**to launch the built-in ```Chromium``` engine from ```your local browser```.
When you log in to Steam by scanning the QR code, all your ```cookies``` are saved in a temporary Chromium user profile created by ```DrissionPage```.**

**After you're done, you can just delete that local user profile.
It's usually located somewhere like:**

**```%TEMP%\DrissionPage\userData\xxxx```**

**For extra safety, you can also ```remove``` this browser's authorization from the ```Steam mobile app```.**
