# Quick Guide:

1. Extract the release, open chrome.exe in the chrome folder, log in to Steam, and check if you can open your screenshot detail page, e.g.:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3353482389


2. Enter your SteamID. For example, visit your profile:
https://steamcommunity.com **/id/** lgsgdsb233/


3. Select the folder to save downloaded screenshots.


4. Select the Chrome for Testing user data folder, usually:
C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome for Testing\User Data


5. Enter the start and end page numbers, then start downloading.
# Three common scenarios:

1. Unable to locate the Steam profile.
If you haven't customized your Steam profile URL, your profile and screenshot pages will start with https://steamcommunity.com/your_steam_ID. However, if you've customized your URL, the prefix will include /id/, such as https://steamcommunity.com/id/lgsgdsb233/.
This software uses the latter format by default, so you may need to customize your URL accordingly.

2. The popped-up Chrome for Testing cannot display the grid view with 50 screenshots.
In this case, you need to manually log in to Steam before using this software. After logging in, try randomly opening a few screenshot detail pages—this will also help ensure that the software can retrieve Steam cookies successfully.

3. Please do not paste Windows-style paths directly.
The file paths should follow Python syntax.
Hmm... maybe I should add an automatic escape feature. (Tag this as: enhance)


# Disclaimer:
In theory, this works just like logging into Steam in Chrome.

If you're worried about security, feel free to **replace the included chromedriver and Chrome for Testing in the release** with your own from official sources.

The .exe is packed using Python tools directly from the source code — I’ve verified it.

For extra peace of mind, **change your Steam password after downloading**.

# Steam Screenshot Downloader

1. **Uses Official Chrome for Testing and ChromeDriver**  
   Utilizes the official Chrome for Testing and matching ChromeDriver for web automation, ensuring compatibility and stability.

2. **Supports All Screenshot Categories**  
   After logging into Steam, the tool can download all screenshots, including *Public*, *Friends Only*, and *Private*, with no restrictions.“You can see it，you can download it.”

3. **Default Download Strategy**  
   - steamcommunity.com/id/**{steam_id}**/screenshots/?p={**page**}&sort=**oldestfirst**&browsefilter=myfiles&view=**grid**&**privacy=30**
   - Downloads **all** available screenshots  
   - Uses **Grid View** mode
   - Starts from **Page 1**, downloading from the **oldest** screenshots first  

4. **File Naming Convention**  
   Downloaded images are named using the **Steam app ID + upload timestamp**, fully consistent with how the Steam client names them. This makes organizing and archiving easier.

5. **Simple Graphical User Interface (GUI)**  
   A basic GUI is provided for users to select the download path, define the page range, and configure the Chrome user data directory.

6. **Multithreaded Support with High Download Speed**  
   The latest version now supports true multithreaded downloading, significantly improving speed. A retry mechanism is included for failed downloads, and automatic Steam cookie retrieval ensures smooth operation.



# 快速指导：
1.解压release，打开chrome文件夹内的chrome.exe，登陆steam，确认一下能否打开自己的截图详情页，例如：https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3353482389

2.输入你的steamID, 例如打开你的个人资料：https://steamcommunity.com/id/lgsgdsb233/

3.选择截图下载的文件夹

4.选择chrome for testing的userdata，通常为：C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome for Testing\User Data

5.输入起止页，开始下载


# 软件特色：
1.下载原始分辨率截图

2.下载次序有依可循

3.不需要手动输入steam cookies

4.下载截图时间为原始F12时的时间

5.生成缩略图，文件夹以及命名保持和steam客户端一致

6.私密、仅好友、成人内容、非steam游戏截图，我能看到它，就能下载它


# 软件大致逻辑：
1.利用chromedriver获取截图地址和steam cookies

2.根据网格视图、最早文件优先的规则下载每页的50张截图

3.从steam云返回的Content-Disposition为每张截图命名并修改Windows文件时间戳

4.文件夹、缩略图、命名规章完全符合steam 客户端


# 声明：
理论上，上述流程跟你在chrome上登陆steam没有任何区别。

如果担心，你可以替换掉release内的chromedriver和chrome for testing，自行在官网下载。

exe文件可以使用python打包工具直接对源代码打包，我已经做过校验。

保险起见，截图下载完成后建议更换一次密码。
