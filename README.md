1. Missing required cookies from Chrome session. Refer to this typical case:[Issue #11](https://github.com/notcookies/Steam_Screenshot_Downloader/issues/11) "I used the Steam app on iOS to log out of all devices. After that, I changed my password. Then I followed the tutorial steps again, and only after that did everything work as expected - the screenshots downloaded."

# How it works?

![alt text](<Untitled diagram-2025-11-04-082418.png>)


# Disclaimer:
1. In theory, this works just like logging into Steam in Chrome.If you're worried about security, feel free to **replace the included chromedriver and Chrome for Testing in the release** with your own from official sources.

2. The .exe is packed using Python tools directly from the source code — I’ve verified it.

3. For extra peace of mind, **change your Steam password after downloading**.
